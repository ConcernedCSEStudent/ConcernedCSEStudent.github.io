        <b>Thank you</b> for taking the time to read this more extensive feedback of the WDT course. I found that
        I did not have quite enough space in the provided feedback form, so naturally, as this is partially a web course,
        I decided it would only be appropriate to make a small website to lay upon you the full extent of my feedback.
        <br> <br>

        <h1 style="text-align:center">Introduction</h1>
        On this page I will share with you my thoughts on the <b>Web and Database Technologies</b> course.
        It should be noted that these are the opinion of the author (which for obvious reasons shall remain anonymous)
        and people the author has spoken to. The author realises that the WDT course has recently been completely overhauled
        and as such understands that the course is prone to having irregularities and imperfections. Nevertheless the 
        author believes that, as <i>feedback is the breakfast of champions</i> it is important to give a retrospective of
        the course from the viewpoint of a student.
    </div>
    <br> <br> 
    <div class="text" id="C2">
        <h1 style="text-align:center">General Feedback</h1>
        First of all I would advice you to put more focus in this course. Right now it feels like we have been taught
        very little about a lot of things. Sure I now know what HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL etc. are, but I feel like
        I am not ready to use them. I know the basics for the exams, but in a month I am pretty sure that I will have lost any proficiency
        I have with any of these languages, because we have spent so little time on them.
        <br> <br>
        Secondly, I wonder why we have theory exams for this very practical course. We have programming exams for OOP and ADS,
        why not make the WDT exams (especially the web exam) practical as well? Iâ€™d much prefer coding more complex programmes 
        on a computer than writing down simples programmes on paper.
        <br> <br>
        Third of all, I would suggest that you provide more support for your TAs, especially when it comes to the job they have
        regarding the assignments. A good start could be to provide reference solutions. This would make it much easier for them to
        help us as students as well. My lab partner and me have been in a situation multiple times where the TA was figuring out alongside
        us what the assignment wanted from us, because they too were unsure what we were supposed to do.
    </div>
    <br> <br>
    <div class="text" id="C3">
        <h1 style="text-align:center">Databases</h1>
        I will order these points in order of magnitude, starting with things that are, from what I understand of university education,
        easier to implement and change, and gradually moving towards larger concerns. 
        <br> <br>
        First of all, and this is a more structural problem with database sciences that Professor Lofi had also warned us about,
        the terminology in databases is a mess. There are internal schemas, conceptual schemas, external schemas, datamodels, and 
        many more, and depending on who you ask those can mean different things. Since for many of us this is the first interaction 
        we have with database sciences, this can be rather confusing. As such I would propose making a reference sheet with the defintions
        that we will be using <i>in this course specifically</i>. If you then upload that to Brightspace at the start of the quarter, 
        students will always have some place to go when they are confused about what the terms mean.
        <br> <br>
        Second of all, during Databases, to me it sometimes felt like the slides had little correlation to the story that was
        being told by Professor Lofi. Stories did not always feel to the point, leaving me wondering what the real take-away of such
        a story or lecture really was. In this regard I also believe that it may not have helped that Professor Lofi skipped slides
        at a rather fast pace (on one occasion we counted that Professor Lofi only discussed half of the slides in his powerpoint. Were 
        the rest of the slides relevant for us? We were unsure).
        <br> <br>
        For me, and most of the students I talked to, the grades we received for the midterm exam were very surprising. Many people found 
        that the grades were much lower than they expected, and much lower than the average grades they had been getting so far (based on 
        the grades from last quarter, and the other midterm exams). Especially on the assignment where we had to make an EER schema (model?)
        many people were surprised by how many points they got deducted. <br> I think part of this surprise came from the lack of feedback we had 
        received thus far on our assignments. We had made an EER schema only a couple of times before (for assignment 1 and for exam practice) 
        but on none of those we got feedback. I myself got less than a quarter of the points on this assignment in the exam, which I found surprising as a TA had told us
        that what my lab partner and me had handed in for assignment one was "probably good" (he did not have a reference solution, it was 
        difficult for him to be sure), and on the practice exams I believed my solutions were close to the provided answers. Difficulty here 
        is also that there is not <i>one</i> solution. As such I just used the method I had used for assignment 1 and assumed it would be fine. 
        Had we received feedback on our assignment 1, I may have been able to readjust my strategy.
        <br> <br>
        The last point in the Database chapter is more of a suggestion, really. It is based on some thinking my friends and me did on how we 
        believe the database part of WDT could feel more purposeful (to reiterate what I wrote in the introduction, WDT feels very much like we 
        learn very little about a lot of things, which does not feel super useful in the long-term). Our conclusion was that for Databases it is 
        perhaps useful to put more emphasis on SQL, a widely-used language that we may very well have to use later on as well. In Databases' current 
        form it does not feel like I properly got the time to practice with it to truly become comfortable with (the basics of) the language. 
        Perhaps if you move SQL forward in the course (spend lecture 1 on <i>what are databases and what are ER databases</i>, lecture 2 on <i>an 
        introduction to SQL</i>) and put more emphasis on learning the language, we believe this may be more useful in the long-term. 
    </div>
    <br> <br>
    <div class="text" id="C4">
        <h1 style="text-align:center">Web</h1>
        If I'm going to be very honest, I prefered Databases over Web. To me it felt like Databases definately had more direction, and was more manageable
        than Web. I think that was mostly caused by the feeling that everytime we would learn something new in Web, before we had had the time to experiment
        with it, and understand properly how it worked, we would have already long moved on to the next thing. If I could only give one point of feedback for 
        Web it would be to remove some of the content, and put more focus on a few aspects of web development (I do not feel like I have gained enough 
        proficiency to tell you which parts would be best/most relevant). The feedback points for Web are a bit more all over the place, I hope that 
        you will bear with me.
        <br> <br>
        I think first of all it is important to address the organisational problems that we encountered during Web. Where Databases would upload the slides (and 
        I suppose for Web the practice code documents as well) a couple days ahead of time, this was not the case with Web, making it neigh impossible to prepare 
        for a lecture ahead of time. I don't really see a reason why you wouldn't upload everything at least a week before hand (or just at the start of the course, 
        that also makes it easier on yourself). <br> Also on organisational bits, we have found that information about the exam was very late, and often insufficient. 
        As of writing this it is about 18 hours before the exam (I know, I should be studying), and we still do not know what materials we need to study for lecture 8. 
        There is very little practice materials, and because we have discussed so many topics in a rather shallow manner we have been told that we only need to know 
        the 'basics'. I find it rather difficult to estimate what the 'basics' are, however. I did just receive a Brightspace announcement stating that more practice 
        questions have been released, which is fantastic, but I would really have liked to have those sooner. 
        <br> <br>
        This final paragraph regards the lectures, and I want to be a bit careful with my feedback here. Part of this will regard the lecturing 
        style of Professor Tahir. I know that such feedback can quickly be seen as a personal attack, so I want to be very clear here that this is not my 
        intention. I aim to point out aspects of his speaking and teaching style that I believe can be improved to increase engagements for the students.  
        <br>I sometimes found it difficult to follow Professor Tahir. I have noticed that he doesn't always speak clearly, and his body posture is rather closed off when he speaks in front 
        of an audience. He mainly speaks to the people in the middle of Echo hall A. For me, who often sits on either the left or right side of the hall, 
        this made me less engaged in his story. I believe it could be beneficial for Professor Tahir to open up his body posture and look around the room 
        more (often). In a recent lecture, a student sitting on the right of the lecture hall had to wait more than 15 minutes for his question to be noticed 
        by Professor Tahir, because his raised hand was not seen by the professor. <br>
        In addition I believe that the pacing of the lecture could be improved. As many of the lectures were tutorial-based (with Professor Tahir 
        going through code examples with us), it was not always easy to keep up. Especially when dealing with new software such as MongoDB, I wasn't always 
        able to keep track of what he was doing. And if you miss out on a small detail, you may derail completely, and lose the ability to follow along with 
        what the professor is doing for the rest of the lecture. To this regard I think uploading code files and software sooner can help, in addition to 
        checking up with the students every now and then to make sure people are still on track.
    </div>
    <br> <br> 
    <div class="text" id="C5">
        <h1 style="text-align:center">Assignments</h1>
        I will start by saying that I like the idea of the assignments. They are a great way to practice with the material 
        we have considered during lectures, and a good opportunity to ask TAs in case of any unclairities. As such my main 
        points of feedback surrounding the assignments regard organisational matters. 
        <br> <br>
        First of all, the deadlines for the assignments were unclear, as there was conflicting information on this (in the 
        slides, various places on Brightspace), and kept changing. In my opinion, the deadlines were also too late, which 
        then created problems with the assignments afterwards. The notion that assignment 5 was due the monday before the 
        exam week, and assignment 6 was due the monday (and later the friday) of the exam week is in my opinion problematic. 
        I myself did not complete assignment 6 because I <i>had</i> to focus on the exams instead. <br>In addition to this 
        the assignments were also uploaded very late. The worst offender for this was the last Web assignment, which was 
        published 5 days before the exam week/deadline. I see no reason why these assignments wouldn't be uploaded sooner, 
        so that people who want to work ahead have all the time and space to do so. 
        <br> <br>
        Then more on the content of the assignments, I sometimes found them a bit unclear. Once again the worst examples to 
        this regard happened in Web, both of the last two assignments were very unclear to me. It is perhaps telling that 
        on a single day we received three announcements via Brightspace detailing what was roughly expected from us for the 
        assignment. This really needs to be better, <i>especially</i> when the TAs also aren't able to help a lot because 
        they too do not have access to reference solutions. 
        <br> <br>
        Lastly, I am wondering where exactly the grades for the assignments are. I know there is a lot of grading that needs 
        to be done by the WDT team, but we haven't even received any word on the first assignment (which was due more than 
        two months ago). Especially because they can also help so much in exam preparation (see what I wrote for paragraph 4 
        in the Databases chapter).  
    </div>
    <br> <br> 
    <div class="text" id="C6">
        <h1 style="text-align:center">Conclusion</h1>
        I will start by thanking you for reading my entire essay. I know that was quite a lot, and I really do appreciate 
        that you are taking the time to consider my feedback. I wrote this because I genuinely think that WDT has a lot 
        of interesting facets, which do not get to shine as brightly as they should. Last year I took a Databases course 
        at another university in the Netherlands, and when I compare WDT to that course I can really notice how the lack of 
        time and focus that we have in WDT takes away from the quality of the course, which is a real shame. <br>
        I hope that you find this feedback helpful, and will implement at least part of it. 
        <br> <br>
